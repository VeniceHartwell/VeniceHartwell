### Hi there 🙋‍♂️!

I am a **Data Analyst and Python Developer.** I work with ETL processes, data analysis and machine learning. I'm especially interested in automation and neural networks — through Python, SQL and bash.

-  🔭 Working on the deployment of my own projects.
-  🌱 Learning about the MarI/O neural network and evolution patterns.
-  💬 Ask me about anything, or tell me about your projects! You can reach me on LinkedIn: [https://LinkedIn.com/in/Venice-Hartwell]
-  👨‍🎓 My repository stores both my personal projects and the lessons I used to train as a DA.

These are the technologies I use for **Data Analysis**:
