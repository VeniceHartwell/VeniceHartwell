Hi there 🙋‍♂️!
I am a data analyst and python developer. I work with ETL processes, data analysis and machine learning. I'm especially interested in automation and neural networks — all through Python, SQL and bash.

🔭 Working on the deployment of my own projects: VeniceHartwell.com
🌱 Learning about the MarI/O neural network and evolution patterns. If you have a project/interest, tell me about it!
💬 Ask me about anything! You can reach me on LinkedIn: LinkedIn.com/in/Venice-Hartwell/
👨‍🎓 My repository stores both my personal projects and the lessons I used to train as a DA.

These are the technologies I use for Data Analysis:

Languages 🧑‍💻	VSC 📆	Databases 🐬	Deployment ☁️	Visualization 📊
Python	Git	SQL	Docker	Python: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
Bash		MongoDB	Heroku	Tableau
