### Hi there 🙋‍♂️!

I am a **Data Scientist and Python Developer.** I build machine learning models and analyze data. I'm especially interested in CNN's (convolutional neural networks). I mainly use Python, SQL and bash.

-  🔭 Working on the deployment of my own machine learning projects.
-  🌱 Learning about Alexnet, Tensorflow, and evolution patterns.
-  💬 Ask me anything, or tell me about your projects! You can reach me on LinkedIn: [https://LinkedIn.com/in/Venice-Hartwell]
-  👨‍🎓 My repository stores both my personal projects and the lessons I used to train myself.

These are the technologies I use for **Data Analysis**:
